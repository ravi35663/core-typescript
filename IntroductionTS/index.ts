/*
==> What is TypeScript
->  TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, enabling developers to 
    catch errors during development and write more maintainable code.    

==> Benefits of using TypeScript over JavaScript:
    1) Static Typing: Catches errors during development.
    2) Improved Code Quality: Enforces better coding practices.
    3) Enhanced IDE Support: Better autocompletion and refactoring.
    4) Easier Maintenance: Clearer code structure and documentation.
    5) Compatibility: Works with existing JavaScript code.

==> Compiling TypeScript to JavaScript:
    -> Single file compile:
        tsc fileName.ts -> this will compile your .ts file into .js file
    -> Compile All Files in a Project (if you have a tsconfig.json file)
        tsc -> this will compile all your .ts file into .js file
        Basic TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json)

==> Installation of TS:
    -> use npm install -g typescript :- to install typescript globally
    -> use tsc --version to check typescript version 

==> CommonJs: 
    ->  CommonJS is a module system used in Node.js that allows you to organize and share 
        JavaScript code across different files using require() to import modules and 
        module.exports to export them.
