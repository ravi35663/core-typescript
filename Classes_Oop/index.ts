/* 
===> Classes and Constructors in TypeScript: 
->  Classes in TypeScript are a blueprint for creating objects. They can contain properties and methods 
    to define the behavior of the objects. 
    The constructor is a special method that gets called when an object is created from the class. 
    Itâ€™s typically used to initialize object properties.

class Person{
    name:string;
    age:number;

    constructor(name:string,age:number){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // method to returns the greetings message 
    greet(){
        return `Hello My name is ${this.name} and my age is ${this.age}`;
    }

/*
==> Access Modifiers in typescripts:
    ->  The access modifiers in typescript is used to defined how class members (methods and properties) 
        can be accessed and modified.
    ->  There are 4 access modifiers in typescript which are 'public', 'private', 'protected' and 
        'readonly'.
    => Public(default): 
        -> Accessible anywhere (inside and outside the class).
        -> All members are public by default if no modifier is specified.

    => private:
        ->  Only accessible within the class itself. Not accessible outside of the class or from 
            subclasses.

    => protected:
        -> Accessible within the class and its subclasses. Not accessible outside of these.

    => readonly:
        ->  Marks a property as read-only. It can only be assigned a value during initialization 
            (either in a constructor or when declared), and cannot be changed afterward.
