/*
===> Interface Vs Types:
--> In TypeScript, both interfaces and type aliases are used to define types, but they have some key 
    differences in terms of syntax, capabilities, and use cases. 
    Here's a breakdown of their differences along with examples.

    1) interface uses 'interface' and type aliases uses 'type' keyword
    2) Extensibility:
        ->  Interface: Can be extended using the extends keyword, allowing for a more straightforward 
            way to create derived interfaces.
        ->  Type Alias: Cannot be extended directly; you would need to create a new type that 
            combines the existing type with additional properties.
    3) Declaration Merging:
        ->  Interface: Supports declaration merging, meaning you can define the same interface multiple 
            times, and TypeScript will merge them into a single interface.
        ->  Type Alias: Does not support declaration merging; defining the same type alias multiple 
            times will result in an error.
    4) Use Cases:
        ->  Interface: Generally preferred for defining the shape of objects or class contracts.
        ->  Type Alias: More versatile, suitable for creating unions, tuples, and other types beyond 
            just object shapes.

/*
Note:
    1)  Use interfaces when you need to define object shapes and take advantage of features like 
        extension and declaration merging.
    2)  Use type aliases for more complex types, such as unions or when you need a simple name for any 
        type, including primitives.
